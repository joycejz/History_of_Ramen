				<div class="info1"><p>In the 1980s, ramen almost started to become a <b>fashion item</b>, not just food. It wasn't only popular among manual workers anymore, and rather than fuel for hard physical work, ramen started to become a <b>hobby</b>. Waiting in line for hours at a special ramen shop became so common that people who did it were given a name, <b>"ramen gyoretsu"</b>. There was also an obsession with <b>special regional varieties</b> of ramen, and fans would travel to far-away places just to taste a new flavor.</p><img class="exit" src="images/exit.png" title="close"></div>
				<div class="info2"><p>A rich tradition of <b>owners allowing employees to start their own restaurants</b> contributed to the growing number of ramen shops. Admirably, Japan ramen shops have managed to avoid the trend toward corporatization - an astonishing eighty percent of them are <b>small businesses</b>.</p><img class="exit" src="images/exit.png" title="close"></div>
				<div class="info3"><p>Given its birth as a <b>foreign import</b>, and the central role that foreign wheat plays in the dish, it's odd that ramen would become a <b>symbol of traditional Japan</b>, but that's exactly what happened. Ramen has gained a reputation as a relatively affordable, youthful, and fashionable representation of Japanese food culture.</p><img class="exit" src="images/exit.png" title="close"></div>
